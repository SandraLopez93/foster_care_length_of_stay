<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has left an impressionable impact in the foster care system, impacting thousands of New York City children, youth and families. Early on in the pandemic, the court system transitioned to a virtual care system, meaning that many of the court hearings were ocurring via Zoom. This unprecedented model caused delays and confusion for many of the families who waited patiently for their cases to be held. </p>

 <p> "A lot of families had their visits or parenting time suspended due to the onset of lockdown measures. Many families were making progress towards expanding that time and moving towards reunifying their families," says Nila Natarajan,Supervising Attorney and Policy Counsel with the Brooklyn Family Defender Service.</p>


<p> "The sudden suspension was detrimental in that one, agencies hampered efforts to get those visits happening regularly again; and two, agencies failed to see that families were working to get back to that place of progress towards reunification," added Nila. </p>
